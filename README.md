# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# HuluClone

Hulu is the leading premium streaming service offering live and on-demand TV and movies, with and without commercials, both in and outside the home.

I re-created the Hulu landing page UI design using HTML, CSS, and React Framework. I use modern CSS3+ techniques like  Flex, opacity, linear gradients, etc
